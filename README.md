## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Nanopositioning

This example demonstrates basic nanopositioning using the platform:

```python
from casimir import Nanopositioning

# Initialize the nanopositioning system
nano_pos = Nanopositioning()

# Set target position
target_position = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
nano_pos.move_to(target_position)
```

### Example 2: Advanced Control with Digital Twin

This example shows how to utilize the digital twin for enhanced control:

```python
from casimir import DigitalTwin

# Initialize the digital twin
digital_twin = DigitalTwin()

# Run simulation
simulation_results = digital_twin.simulate(target_position)

# Adjust control parameters based on simulation
nano_pos.adjust_parameters(simulation_results)
```
